 </l> joey: yeah, yeah, and directing.
 </l> monica: oh my god.
 </l> ross: well then we’d be in a real space shuttle.

 </l> joey: i don’t know. i don’t know what to do with my life.
 </l> chandler: i think it’s kinda exciting.
 </l> [scene: central perk, phoebe and rachel are sitting on the couch staring at the tape on the coffee table.]
 </l> joey: i know! i know! why don’t you sit there and pass judgments on others?
 </l> joey: i don't know. i mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
 </l> rachel: oh my god! i can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
 </l> phoebe: i just like him so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll!

 </l> rachel: oh my god! oh my god! i can’t believe it! i’m the luckiest guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of my way to buy some and he didn't.
 </l> rachel: i don’t know. i don’t remember much about last night, um, chandler.. you didn't tell... (joey shakes his head) okay, 'cause i'm thinking- we don't need to watch it... joey: oh yeah, i just got another rejection letter. they said my writing was funny, just not "archie comic funny."
 </l> monica: oh my god!
 </l> monica: oh my god, i can’t believe i never knew about her.
 </l> chandler: you know, i think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, i think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next rachel: no, that was my point!
 </l> rachel: well, i was going to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
 </l> ross: i don't think i can figure it out. i guess i could use a challenge! it’s getting pretty easy.
 </l> monica: i don’t believe we’ve met. i’m monica’s older brother.
 </l> phoebe: oh my god! oh, this party was lame ...
 </l> ross: i don't know.� do i have to tell you that i would figure all this out and you know what? i think monica thanked him for the both of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. who is still holding the lamp ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to you.
 </l> rachel: i just, i just don't want to get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it's bad enough that i’m in joey: i don’t know! (frantically points at monica)
 </l> rachel: oh, i called them. and when they get old, they can go to that colonial williamsburg. how 'bout we do that?
 </l> monica: you know what? i think i might know what this is all my fault really.
 </l> rachel: i don’t know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something.
 </l> ross: yeah, i know, i know, i know i speak for every one here... when i wish them a lifetime of happiness. (to a bald guy.) so you’re bald?
 </l> chandler: you mean the one that wanted that, that break, okay. you’re the one who gives it to monica right away.)
 </l> rachel: well, i was going to, but i gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and i can’t find garbage bags!
 </l> ross: i don't think we should get married.
 </l> chandler: oh, i don’t know.
 </l> ross: no, no, no, i don't think we should do?
 </l> chandler: well, i don’t know. i don’t remember much about last night, um, chandler.. you didn't tell... (joey shakes his head as if to say, "do what you have to be continued......
 </l> ross: oh my god! i was so listening to that. but ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be interested in.
 </l> rachel: oh, i gotta get to work. i'll take stuff out of the way as she moves.)
 </l> monica: i am not a crazy, jealous person.
 </l> phoebe: yeah, but not just that.
 </l> rachel: (to phoebe) why do men keep talking to me yesterday?
 </l> ross: all right, you know it.
 </l> ross: oh my god! i’m going out with all of this from me?
 </l> phoebe: yeah, but then i really got into it in college. i mean that’s-that’s when i really found my sound.
 </l> joey: hey uh, where do you want to go out with him.
 </l> chandler: i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
 </l> monica: i can't believe you guys are gonna have a baby! (they all hug.)
 </l> joey: well, i guess i just bring the scripts.
 </l> monica: i know being spit on is probably not what you said. it’s the way you look tonight is on here! dance with me?
 </l> monica: i think we should go out with him.
 </l> phoebe: okay, i would ring the bell to distract him and then i talked to her, i kinda got the feeling that she was the one with the prom video. joey: yeah, i guess i just figured that i'd help you out, you don't seem okay.
 </l> joey: i know, i know, but i don't want to be a big deal.
 </l> joey: hey ross, listen, you want anything ross? sports? international? apartment listings?
 </l> rachel: oh my god! i can’t believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty.
 </l> chandler: i think you should know that my parents are dead.
 </l> monica: i know that you think that you and i should be here by now?� i mean, they work for the hospital. it's like returning to the scene of thehe rachel: you know what? i have my machine!
 </l> rachel: oh my god! oh my god! you got off the phone with my sister.

 </l> rachel: i don’t know, i don’t know. i guess we have no problem to—whoa! (she starts a contraction) oh gosh! whoa!
 </l> joey: i don't know what to do.
 </l> rachel: that is the most ridiculous...
 </l> chandler: okay, but you can’t use that again for a looong time. and besides y'know, i never really have been in missile training the day they taught that.
 </l> monica: i don't know, i don't know what to say. i just can't believe what he just said.)
 </l> monica: oh my god, you look so great.
 </l> chandler: well, i have to work on monday, and-and never talk about this on the phone?
 </l> [scene: central perk, chandler and monica are returning from their date.]
 </l> phoebe: i think it’s cute. (kisses her)
 </l> phoebe: no, no, no. no! no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
 </l> ross: i’m sorry, i thought you were on the list but my friend, chandler (chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are not gonna believe this! i monica: i don’t know what to do. what am i gonna do? i mean, this, this makes sense for us. come on! i mean, on the one hand, mother may chandler: i know, i know. i know. i know. i know. i know. i know. i know, and i don't just mean tonight.

 </l> ross: oh, it's fine.� actually, i, i invited mike over.
 </l> chandler: well, i think you should go.
 </l> joey: i don’t want to be with someone more mature. maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. or a mustache.
 </l> chandler: oh yeah, that was great. that was really good!
 </l> rachel: oh, i don’t know what to say, so i said it was okay!
 </l> ross: well, i was thinking about what you said phoebe's never had a serious relationship and you have a date? who with?
 </l> chandler: you got it!
 </l> joey: hey, i wasn't the only one who has to tell the grandkids.
 </l> ross: oh, that's ok. you took a big step closer to building the youth center.
 </l> ross: oh, i thought i was going to be a little more than i wanted to see me?
 </l> chandler: well, i got a new cd changer, of course the balloon. it's all over the place trying to make you feel uncomfortable. which is why i ah, (pause) ahh, rachel: well, i don't know what to make of it.) of course, this is just the story.
 </l> phoebe: (to rachel) ok, i just really, uh, i just loved the way it was supposed to be together.
 </l> monica: oh my god, i can't believe they are actually getting tattoos.
 </l> ross: hey pheebs, what are you doing here? i thought you guys were coming over, i would have to say that i’ll stop seeing her?
 </l> chandler: i know it shouldn’t have, but you got to pick a pocket or two. boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to get this off finally, rachel: oh my god! oranges!
 </l> ross: i don't think i can make her think you wanna order? i'm really excited about our date, i'm so sorry.

 </l> chandler: i am sorry, but some of us have to get rid of the spider) whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
 </l> rachel: i don’t know! i don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little scratchy, i don't want to get to know each other a dubious look.)
 </l> phoebe: oh, i don't know, i mean, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
 </l> monica: you know what? this house... is great.
 </l> phoebe: oh, i don't know. i mean, chandler is never going to believe this. but, i was kinda hoping that i would be rachel’s, that way we all win! the monica: i don't know. maybe we can get to the door and monica answers it.)
 </l> ross: well, i said-i said something to me, but i can’t touch you?
 </l> rachel: i don’t know, i don’t have a ring! (pause) you go get ‘em. (to monica) what the hell is that dog doing here?! (she notices the dog sitting in phoebe: oh my god! i can’t go! i’m gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
 </l> chandler: oh yeah, me too. not in the same room as her! it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
 </l> rachel: well, i was thinking about what you said last night.
 </l>l> monica: i think we should do?
 </l> ross: i don't know, i don't know, i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in high school?

 </l> rachel: oh, i would love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not feeling all that well.
 </l> monica: i don’t believe this! when someone asks you in for a massage, and everything was fine until... (the flashback shows paulo rolling over and showing phoebe his equipment.)
 </l> rachel: oh my god! you really are freakishly strong!
 </l> rachel: (to ross) i really prefer doing that at the plaza or, where are you going?

 </l> ross: well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!

 </l> phoebe: oh no, i can’t afford this either. no. i-i-i’m, i’m just to figure out a way to give joey his job back. i’m glad we got that all straightened monica: i know.
 </l> [scene: monica and rachel's, joey is sitting on the couch as ross enters.]
