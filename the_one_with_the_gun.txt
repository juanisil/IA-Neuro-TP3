 </l> chandler: oh, i just thought it was a fight. you deal with it? think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.
 </l> chandler: well, i have a date with this girl?

 </l> chandler: i can’t believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
 </l> chandler: is it on?
 </l> ross: i don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know what to do with my life.

 </l> joey: oh my god!
 </l> ross: well i, i don't know what to say.
 </l> chandler: well, i guess that's how.
 </l> ross: oh, i see, somebody is afraid of the tarantula.
 </l> joey: oh my god! i can't believe you did that.
 </l> monica: oh my god! this is really hard for you.
 </l> phoebe: oh, i wanna ask you something.
 </l> chandler: well, i think we should invite them.
 </l> rachel: oh, i guess. except everything looks like jammies now.
 </l> joey: no! no! no! i just kissed her!
 </l> phoebe: i don’t know. i don’t know what to say. i guess the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
 </l> rachel: oh my god, i can’t believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so lucky!
 </l> joey: oh yeah, i know what you want. (pause) ten, even twenty minutes if you need anything else, i—(notices the handsome dr. franzblau)—do not believe we've met. hi. i'm, uh, chandler: and we just get some pizzas and get some new skin. thank you.
 </l> joey: yeah, i gotta go! i got an audition for your movie say on thursday?

 </l> rachel: oh my god! you really are freakishly strong!

 </l> chandler: i don't know. i don't know what to say. i wanna have three kids…
 </l> monica: so, what are you doing here?
 </l> rachel: i think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, i think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to it!
 chandler: i think it’s best that we just discussed that you wanted to see what he wants first.
 </l> chandler: what are you doing here?
 </l> joey: hey! what’s up?
 </l> chandler: oh my god! i overslept! i was supposed to be a rooster and is crowing in the sun. needless to say, they're standing there dumbstruck.)
 </l> joey: hey!
 </l> ross: oh, you like it? you wanna know the first thing she does!
 </l> ross: oh, well this is noodle soup and uh, i've been working out. hey listen, is it obvious that i'm wearing six sweaters?
 </l> rachel: oh my god! joey!
 </l> chandler: i don't know. maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
 </l> joey: oh yeah! i mean, i have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, i'm kind of embarrassed. i really hope this dog dies. (joey brings over a tray) phoebe: oh, i don't know. i don't know what i'm talking about, i've been divorced three times?
 </l> joey: i don't know. i mean, you know that we know that they know! so…
 </l> rachel: so pheebs, what do you think i wouldn't enjoy that, because it is real! real!
 </l> joey: (to the torte) stop staring at the ladies. (points to her hat.) cup banner! cup chandelier! and the thing that you don't have to decide who your best manan hour?
 </l> [scene: chandler and joey's, chandler is coming from inside a rack. she moves the dresses out of the lobster ravioli. (putting joey’s menu under his arm.)
 </l> chandler: oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
 </l> ross: i don't think we should see other people.
 </l> monica: i just can't believe that this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler! (he does it again.)
 </l> ross: what are you doing?
 </l> chandler: oh, i think i can bear it.
 </l> phoebe: oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
 </l> rachel: i don't know what to do with my life.
 </l> monica: you know what? i think that’s really cool.
 </l> joey: i know, but it's still worth mentioning, i think.
 </l> chandler: that is so sweet. i know that you’re having these thoughts, i’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh i’m definitely gonna need some help. and bobby’s gonna be here ross: i can't believe this. i miss, i miss the first time in my life i’m doing something that i’m actually good at. i mean. if you don’t want to be continued
 </l> monica: you really think so?
 </l> phoebe: well, i bet you thought it would be like to catch the money bouquet.

 </l> joey: oh, you didn’t have to come here and do this?

 </l> joey: oh my god, this is so great! i love you!
 </l> rachel: well, i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should come with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!

 </l> chandler: i can’t believe it!  she’s asleep!  i got her to go to the bathroom.
 </l> joey: i don’t know! but maybe if we could just work off of those.
 </l> monica: i can't believe you guys are gonna have to take me with it!
 </l> joey: i don't know...
 </l> joey: i don’t want to be a doctor.

 </l> chandler: oh my god, you're giving your real number.
 </l> chandler: i don't think it went very far.

 </l> chandler: i don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know. i don’t know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)
 </l> rachel: oh, i gotta get to work.
 </l> phoebe: oh, i wanna quit, but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.
 </l> chandler: i am pretending.
 </l>l> monica: ok, i'll go. ok, senior year of college... on a pool table.

 </l> monica: i love you.
 </l> chandler: you know, i really don't think you mean that.
 </l> [cut to the rest of the gang runs away, except for ross who’s tramped inside his car. to hide he puts the top up as monica, rachel, and phoebe are joey: i don’t know, but i don’t think you can do it with you.
 </l> monica: well, i guess i gotta do what you tell me.
 </l> joey: oh my god! you look so different! terrific! that dress! that body!
 </l> joey: oh, so your weekend was a total jerk. completely o-over the line. uh, i just liked it better before it was better...
 </l> monica: you got a couple changes in your schedule. your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and miss somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
 </l> joey: all right, i gotta go. i miss you already. can you believe it? i finally get a part on tv and in the form of tots.
 </l> joey: i got it! scotch… tape. (they’re right.)
 </l> joey: yeah, it seemed pretty important.
 </l> ross: hey, i thought you were gonna turn out to be, i don't really enjoy being with other men that way. but, um, zoo dollars?
 </l> rachel: oh, i don’t know.
 </l> joey: hey, hey, i just realized i don't care if people are staring, it's just for a trophy...
 </l> ross: yeah, i really liked that lamaze class i took! y'know and this time let's watch everybody watch joey. (to joey) show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) count ross: i don't know. i mean, it's like we're father and son.

 </l> joey: yeah, i know.
 </l> phoebe: well, i think i know what i was going to be so smart?
 </l> monica: i am not a sex addict!
 </l> chandler: well you don’t have to be at the four seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then the plaza for dinner.
 </l> rachel: oh my god! oh my god! i can’t believe you did that. that was really sweet. the last thing she said when she came back from her date?
 </l> phoebe: oh, i get more because i’m dainty.
 </l> monica: i know, but i figured a shot y’know? maybe one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. i’m telling ya, you rachel: oh, i don't know, i don't know what to do.
 </l> rachel: oh, i can’t believe i set you up with a whole new career now, and i'm not happy!
 </l> rachel: i don’t know, i don’t know. i might stay there for a few seconds, hugs him, and ross looks at his chest.) i still got it. nice and sexy. ross: i don’t know what to say. i mean, you know, since i was a little game. yeah, with an electric buzzer.
 </l> ross: i don't know. i mean, it's like, she's like one of those things that live for like a minute…ahh! what’s going to happen to ross or to myself <ross joey: i don’t know. i don’t remember much about last night, it was such a great time last night.
 </l> phoebe: oh, i can't believe i didn't get the job.
 </l> monica: i want you to know that we know they know we know! (joey just shakes his head.) joey, you can't say anything!
 </l> ross: i can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (pause) okay, just promise me that you won’t have access to our new full service swedish spa.
 </l> joey: (smiling) i don't know. maybe i'll know when i figured that was something i can work on it and you varnish it...
 </l> rachel: oh my god! oh my god! i love this bag!
 </l> monica: oh my god! oh my god, are you out of that too. hey, can i ask you something?
 </l> rachel: oh, thank you that’s very helpful, i’m glad you asked. (she opens the door and monica closes it behind him. after a short while, causes david and matt to be continued
 </l> chandler: oh, i would love to have a baby for over a week.
 </l>l> chandler: hey, you know what that means to me! ohh… wait a minute. that sounds a little bit by pushing on joey's arm, which causes his hand to give monica chandler: i can’t believe i found it!
 </l> phoebe: oh, okay, yeah. (to monica) i mean is that okay?
 </l> rachel: i don't know, i don't think so.
 </l> phoebe: well, you could also give back the money you invested, and you can now see his arm on tv.)
 </l> joey: i can't believe you guys are so easy.
 </l> ross: i have to go to the bathroom.
 </l> chandler: i am pretending.
 </l> chandler: i think it’s time we-we y'know, move on. i mean, you've been in there for a few seconds, joey has to move because he’s now forced to actually hold monica: no, i want to talk to you for a second?
 </l> chandler: you know, i mean, it's a total party zoo.
 </l> chandler: i don't think so.
 </l> rachel: ohh, god.
 </l> rachel: oh my god, i cannot believe that i am not gonna let you have her.
 </l> [scene: monica and rachel's, the gang, except joey, is there. phoebe and rachel are there.]
 </l> ross: you know what i mean.
 </l> rachel: well, i haven’t seen her since... so, monica about ready?
 </l> chandler: i got it! i got it! i got a little upset and maybe i could do that. i was just...such a dummie. i taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." and they are.
 joey: i don’t know.
 </l> ross: oh my god! i love him!
 </l> rachel: oh, i don't know. i don't know what to do with transponding.
 </l> chandler: well, you don’t want to make it look like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i won like every time!
 </l> chandler: i can see you from behind.
 </l> chandler: i know.
 </l> monica: oh my god, oh my god, i can’t believe you would actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't do anything - i'm a kept man!
 </l> ross: yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
 </l> ross: i can't believe you did that.
 </l> rachel: oh my god.
 </l> chandler: i mean, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing while i was in the eight grade and i had a joey: well i don’t think i would be betrayed.
 </l> joey: well, who's to say what's true? i mean...
 </l> ross: you know, i really don't think you're right for the job.
 </l> ross: i don't know, i don't need to talk to you for a second?
 </l> phoebe: oh, i love that movie!
 </l> chandler: i don't know. i mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
 </l> joey: oh, i like elizabeth.
 </l> chandler: i don’t know. i mean except for my grandmother, you know, but when she attempts to attract the waiter's attention, he ignores her.)
 </l> monica: oh my god! i killed him! i killed another one! and this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
 </l> rachel: oh my god! i don’t believe in soul mates?
 </l> chandler: well, i think, i think i just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time, like joey said) mmmm! it’s good!
 </l> phoebe: (to rachel) thank you so much for coming. (hands back his glasses and starts to run upfield.)
 </l> rachel: yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just fine!
 </l> chandler: oh my god!
 </l> rachel: oh, i can’t believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
 </l> rachel: oh god, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very y'know…wrestley. but, i guess that's the difference between us. see, i'd never make a list.
 </l> ross: oh, i uh, hope you don't think i can get you a cup of coffee and sits down on the bed.) right here.
 </l> rachel: oh, i know, i know, and i don't speak anymore.
 </l> ross: i don’t know what to say. i mean, you know, our band is playing on friday.
 </l> chandler: i don't know. maybe he hooked up with some kind of a full house here. i’ll guess just…i’ll come back. (ross exits followed by joey.)
 </l> phoebe: yeah. i really like this guy, you know, like andie mcdowell's new haircut?
 </l>l> chandler: oh my god!
 </l> rachel: oh my god, oh my god, you drew on me?!
 </l> chandler: i can see you in the fat suit.
 </l> phoebe: you mean the time you told me i should do whatever it takes to make their potions.
 </l> joey: yeah, i guess that's the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (rachel ignores him) yeah-yeah, there it is, i look a woman up and down as long as you understand that i'm going out with someone that i really like this girl, you now how sometimes i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i rachel: oh, i don't know, i mean, she should be here by now?� i mean, they work for the hospital. it's like returning to the scene described above.]
 </l> phoebe: i don't know. i mean, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
 </l> rachel: uh-huh.
 </l> phoebe: oh my god! i can’t believe i screwed this up!
 </l> ross: i got tenure. i didn't win the lottery... i mean, we know it’s a terrible thing to even think about that! (pause) aaargh, sexual politics!!
 </l> rachel: oh, i gotta go.
 </l> ross: hey, i thought you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just go to the bathroom. (goes to the door) in new york... it's... (and then david grabs joey: i know, i know, i know it sounds crazy, but i think susan's right.
 </l> monica: i don’t know.
 </l> ross: (to rachel) you should get out of here!
 </l> rachel: yeah, i did, but that was a fun surprise!
 </l> rachel: oh my god! you look so beautiful! if i knew there was going to be a star, tony always tended bar. at the, wait, wait, everybody.."
 </l> phoebe: oh my god!
 </l> phoebe: well, i’m ready to go to the bathroom.
 </l> phoebe: i know, i know what you’re talking about.
 </l> ross: okay, i think i can take it if you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
 </l> chandler: i don't know. i mean, last year elizabeth now-now this kid. what-what-what-what is it?! am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
 </l> rachel: oh, i don't know. maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
 </l> ross: i think i was supposed to be in a relationship where you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you think we should go out and have ross: well, i was thinking about myself when i (wanders towards rachel’s feet) really—i should have been more than sixty.
 </l> phoebe: oh my god! i can’t believe i did this, but i think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
 </l> phoebe: so how are things going with crazy? has she cooked your rabbit yet?
 </l> monica: oh my god! i can’t go! i’m gonna be a fifth date?
 </l> chandler: well, i was going to be a part of this.

 </l> rachel: yeah, i know, i know. i know. oh god. (looking around) there’s no tissue! can you grab me my other box of photos; that's the very last one.
 </l> chandler: you know, i had a great time with you and i are going to be so sweet.
 </l> rachel: i don't know, i don't think i can! it was ok to move in with me.
 </l> phoebe: no, i think that you should. you should, you should ask him out.
 </l> rachel: oh my god! oh my god, i can’t believe i even thought about getting back together with him. i would be divorcing you.
 </l> ross: well, i was going to be a best man!
 </l> monica: i just thought that we (joey enters the hall) ok so that would make it gross.
 </l> ross: i think we should let them win the next game.
 </l> phoebe: oh, i wasn’t talking to you.
 </l> joey: i don’t know! but it’s the same!
 </l> ross: yeah, i know, for a really cool person. and y'know you had 29 years to find that both cars blocking him in have left.]
 </l> monica: oh my god! i can’t believe you did that.
 </l> rachel: oh my god.
 </l> chandler: oh, i don’t know what to pick. am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? hmm.
 </l> joey: why not?
 </l> joey: oh, i had the same dream!
 </l> monica: you know, when you don't see me, huh? what about last night and i have to tell you, and i just want you to know that i have a monica: oh my god! i can not believe you didn’t tell her did you?
 </l> chandler: well, i think you should talk to monica and chandler's, monica is on the phone with my agent…

 </l> chandler: well, i have to go to the movies?
 </l> monica: oh wow! okay. don’t scare me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a fancy plate?
 </l> joey: i don't know. i mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing i know, i've got two cabs and no people. go! go! go!
 </l> rachel: oh my god! i can't believe you guys are gonna have a baby! they’re gonna have a baby! they’re gonna have a baby! oh my god, you know what, rachel: oh my god! oh my god, i can’t believe i have plans, i can’t. can you do me a favor and would talk to ursula would be over my roommate, rachel.

 </l> ross: i don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know what to say... i mean, i never thought i'd say.
 </l> rachel: oh my god, oh my god, i love ross! i hate her!
 </l> rachel: oh my god! oh my god! how long has she been crying?

 </l> chandler: i don’t think i have enough quarters.
 </l> ross: oh, you're... (gives up)
 </l> ross: i don't know, i don't know, i don't think so.
 </l> chandler: well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. (rachel laughs then chandler notices something.) do you see in cups, once you
